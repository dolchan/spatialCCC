The goal of **spatialCCC** package is to investigate cell-cell signaling, by analyzing ligand-receptor interactions in spatial transcriptomic data.

## Installation

You can install the development version of spatialCCC from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("dolchan/spatialCCC")
```


## Example

This is a basic example which shows you a basic workflow of the package:

  * First, load required R packages.
```{r just-FYI, include=FALSE}
# Looks like ggraph might have some issue importing 'guide_edge_colourbar'.
#   @importFrom didn't work.
#  @importFrom & @export, a.k.a. didn't work, either.
# adding ggraph to 'Depends' worked.
# library(ggraph)
```

```{r message = FALSE}
library(spatialCCC)
```

  * Then, load built-in LR database.
```{r LRdb-loading}
set.seed(100)

LRdb_m <- 
  get_LRdb("mouse", n_samples = 100)

LRdb_full <-
  get_LRdb("mouse")
```

  * Load an example Visium spatial transcriptomic data
```{r visium-data-loading}
data_dir <- file.path("example", "visium_tutorial")
spe_brain <-
  SpatialExperiment::read10xVisium(samples = data_dir,
                                   type = "HDF5",
                                   data = "filtered")

# Log-Normalize
spe_brain <- scater::logNormCounts(spe_brain)
```


### Cell-cell communication analysis

  * Compute Cell-Cell Communications over ligand-receptor pairs
```{r compute-spatial-ccc}
#future::plan(future::multisession, workers = 8)

ccc_graph_list <-
  compute_spatial_ccc_graph_list(spe = spe_brain,
                                 assay_name = "logcounts",
                                 LRdb = LRdb_full, 
                                 workers = 8)

#future::plan(future::sequential)
```


```{r convert-to-ccc_graph-list}
# ccc_graph_tbl <-
#   compute_spatial_ccc_tbl(spe = spe_brain,
#                                  assay_name = "logcounts",
#                                  LRdb = LRdb_m, 
#                                  workers = 4)
# 
# ccc_graph_list <-
#   to_spatial_ccc_graph_list(ccc_tbl = ccc_graph_tbl,
#                             spatial_data = get_spatial_data(spe_brain),
#                             workers = 1)  
```


### Cell-cell commuication visualization

  * Spatial CCC graph plot with tissue image

```{r spatial-ccc-with-tissue-image, warning=FALSE}
LR_of_interest <- "Pdgfb_Pdgfra"

plot_spatial_ccc_graph(
  ccc_graph = ccc_graph_list[[LR_of_interest]],
  tissue_img = SpatialExperiment::imgRaster(spe_brain),
  node_color = "group",
  edge_color = "group",
  which_on_top = "edge"
)
```



```{r spatial-ccc-with-tissue-image, warning=FALSE}
LR_of_interest <- "Pdgfb_Pdgfra"

plot_spatial_ccc_graph(
  ccc_graph = ccc_graph_list[[LR_of_interest]],
  tissue_img = SpatialExperiment::imgRaster(spe_brain),
  node_color = "group",
  edge_color = "group",
  which_on_top = "node"
)
```


  * Spatial CCC graph plot without tissue image
  
In this case, graph layout can be "spatial" which keeps the original spatial locations, 
or other graph layout algorithm supported by igraph package. 


```{r spatial-ccc-with-spatial-layout}
plot_spatial_ccc_graph(
  ccc_graph = ccc_graph_list[[LR_of_interest]],
  graph_layout = "spatial",
  node_color =  "group",
  node_size = 1,
  edge_color = "group_diameter",
  clip = TRUE,
  which_on_top = "edge"
)
```

  * Spatial CCC graph plot with "auto", a.k.a., "kk" spring layout
  
In this format and the one below,  one can see the distribution of cell-cell 
communication clusters

```{r spatial-ccc-with-kk-layout, warning=FALSE}
plot_spatial_ccc_graph(
  ccc_graph = ccc_graph_list[[LR_of_interest]],
  node_color = "group",
  node_size = 0.1,
  edge_color = "group_diameter",
  edge_width = 0.1,
  which_on_top = "edge"
)
```

  * Spatial CCC graph plot with "stress" layout

```{r spatial-ccc-with-stress-layout, warning=FALSE}
plot_spatial_ccc_graph(
  ccc_graph = ccc_graph_list[[LR_of_interest]],
  # tissue_img = SpatialExperiment::imgRaster(spe_brain),
  graph_layout = "stress",
  node_color = "group",
  edge_color = "group_diameter",
  edge_width = 0.25,
  which_on_top = "edge"
)
```
